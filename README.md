# shadow578's (trashy) Advent of Code 2021

This repo containy my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/), each day solved using a different high- tech technology. <br>
If you want to see my boring (but probably more up to date) solutions to AoC21, take a look at [my solutions in Node.js](https://github.com/shadow578/AdventOfCode2021).  

To run the solutions, see the README in each days directory
